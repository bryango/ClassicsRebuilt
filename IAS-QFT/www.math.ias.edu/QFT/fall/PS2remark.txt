The following has been pointed out about exercise 5 in problem
set 2.

(a) I omitted to state that a connection on the SO(n) bundle
Q over M is part of the data.  It is certainly needed later.

(b) there is a slip in part (b) of the problem - it was meant
to be said that the odd part of lambda is left-moving 
(as is implied correctly later in part (c) ) 

Extra credit to anyone who points out additional errors!
