In the second homework problem, one is to assume that one is given
not just the odd distribution generated by

D = d/d theta - theta d/dt

but the actual vector field D generating this distribution.


That is the analog of the fact that in the first problem, to make
sense of the Lagrangian one needs the metric (dt)^2 on R.
