The reading for the next two lectures consists of two papers

``Mirror Manifolds And Topological Field Theory''

`` On the Landau-Ginzburg Description Of N=2 Minimal Models''

where the n^{th} paper, for n=1,2, corresponds to the n^{th} lecture.

The reading for the next lecture after that will be a review
article by Affleck, Dine, and Seiberg on N=1 models in four dimensions.
