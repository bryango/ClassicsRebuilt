                    IAS QUANTUM FIELD THEORY PROGRAM

As mentioned in a previous message, the first lectures in the IAS quantum
field theory program will be delivered by Joseph Bernstein, on
super-geometry (``how to write Lagrangians with fermionic variables'').
These lectures will begin in mid-September (precise dates to be announced
later).

We asked Joseph if there was some background reading that the participants
could do to prepare themselves for his lectures.  Here is his response:

     One paper, which David Kazhdan found and sent me, proved very useful.
     This is a review by M. Sohnius " Introducing Supersymmetry" in
     Review section of Physics letters v.128, Numbers 2,3 (1985), p.39-204.

     The book of Bagger and Wess is also rather useful.

(That book is entitled ``Supersymmetry and Supergravity'', and is published
by Princeton University Press.)
