From: Edward Witten <witten@sns.ias.edu>



Reading for Witten's lecture this week:

T. Buscher, ``Path Integral Derivation Of Quantum Duality In
Nonlinear Sigma Models,'' Phys. Lett. B201 (1988) 466.


E. Witten, ``On S-Duality In Abelian Gauge Theories,'' Selecta
Math. 1 (1995) 383, section 2 ONLY.


A. M. Polyakov, in {\it Gauge Fields And Strings}, pp. 62-72.
Please note that Polyakov's treatment is based on a lattice approach;
he only mentions the equivalent continuum version in the last 1-2 pages.
The lecture will be phrased in continuum language.


Reading for next week's lecture:

The chapter on ``Lumps'' in Coleman's book {\it Secret Symmetry}.


All selections will be available from P. Bozzay or V. Nowak in C building.
